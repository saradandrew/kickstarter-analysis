# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview
This project analyzes how many outcomes and goals were met in Louise's crowdfunding efforts

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to record and follow the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays.

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed this analysis by creating a two charts that reflect the number of theater outcomes that were successful, how many failed, and how many were canceled each month. I found it challenging to exclude live projects from my analysis.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater outcomes were more successful in the spring time with May and June being the most successful months. 

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The number of successful outcomes was higher when the goal was set between $1,000 to $4,999, but this was also when the there was the most failed outcomes. Outcomes were more successful when the goal was less than $15,000, and there were more failed outcomes when the goal was higher than $20,000.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I found it very difficult to remove the presence of live outcomes from my "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" line chart.

## Results
- Two conclusions I can make about Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that outcomes are more successful when launched in late spring/early summer (May and June specifically) and they are least successful when launched in the fall or winter time.

- I can conclude that goals are more likely to be successful when they are set at $10,000 or less.

- A limitation of this dataset is that the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date is not filtered by year, so we are not able to analyze trends over the different years the crowdfunding efforts occurred. Another limitation is that the Outcomes Based on Goals does not include dates at all so we are not able to analyze the differences throughout the months and years.

- We could create a stacked bar chart for this analysis that shows the number of successful, failed, and canceled otcomes throughout a period of time. We could also create a pie chart to help with visualization between the successful and failed goals.
